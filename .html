        <li> He enrolled in Queens College, a part of the City University of New York.

        <li> In the 1970s, his interest in computing encouraged him into Silicon Valley's Homebrew Computer Club, where he was the only black member at the time and eventually crossed paths with Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. He referred to Jobs as a business-minded "sparkplug" and was unimpressed when he interviewed Wozniak for a job.

        <li> His work allowed people to play a variety of games in their homes and paved the way for systems, such as the Atatri 2600, Nintendo, Xbox and Playstation.

        <li> On April 9, 2011, Jerry Lawson died in Mountain View, California due to complications relating to his diabetes. He was survived by his wife, Catherine, and his two children.
